# Space-Invader
A basic ripoff of the original Space Invader game. 
This game is mostly self-explanatory, but the basic gist is you shoot bullets (With the spacebar) at aliens while moving left and right (With the left and right arrow keys).
You have to keep shooting at them until they reach a specific level (Y = 440), where it is game over.
